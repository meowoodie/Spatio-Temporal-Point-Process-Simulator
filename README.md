Marked Spatio-Temporal Point Process Simulator
===

A set of Python tools called `STPPG` for simulating any form of Marked Spatio-temporal self-exciting point processes. 

### Usage

There are two critical files included in this repo: 

- `stppg.py` includes basic generators for homogeneous and inhomogeneous univariate point process, as well as various types of intensity classes and kernel functions.
- `utils.py` includes plotting functions for visualizing the point process simulation.

For simulating any parametric point process defined in references, we first need to define the `parametric form` of its conditional density and `event space` (time, location, and marks). 

- To define the form of the conditional density of a point process, a `Lam` object defined in `stppg.py` needs to be substantiated accordingly. The most important parameters of a conditional intensity `Lam` is defined in its kernel function. See the example below.
- For spatio-temporal point processes, time is specified by 1D two-elements list `T`, and location & mark space is jointly specified by 2D list `S`, where first two sub-lists indicate the location X and Y, and the following sub-lists indicate the mark space.  

### Examples

A simple example of simulating a spatio-temporal hawkes point process equipped with a standard diffusion kernel by using `stppg`.
```python
from stppg import StdDiffusionKernel, HawkesLam
from utils import plot_spatio_temporal_points, plot_spatial_intensity

np.random.seed(0)
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

# parameters initialization
mu     = .1
kernel = StdDiffusionKernel(C=1., beta=1., sigma_x=.1, sigma_y=.1)
lam    = HawkesLam(mu, kernel, maximum=1e+3)
pp     = SpatialTemporalPointProcess(lam)

# generate points
points, sizes = pp.generate(
    T=[0., 10.], S=[[-1., 1.], [-1., 1.]], 
    batch_size=500, verbose=True)

# plot intensity of the process over the time
plot_spatial_intensity(lam, points[0], S=[[0., 10.], [-1., 1.], [-1., 1.]],
    t_slots=1000, grid_size=50, interval=50)
```

And see the console output below.
