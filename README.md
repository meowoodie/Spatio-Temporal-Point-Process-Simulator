Marked Spatio-Temporal Point Process Simulator
===

A set of Python tools called `STPPG` for simulating any form of Marked Spatio-temporal self-exciting point processes. 

### Usage

There are two vital files included in this repo: 

- `stppg.py` basic generators for homogeneous and inhomogeneous univariate point process, as well as different kinds of intensity classes and kernel functions.
- `utils.py` Some simple plotting functions for visualizing the point process simulation.

For simulating any parametric point process defined in references, we need to define the `parametric form` of its conditional density  and `generating space` (time, location, and marks). 

- To define the form of the conditional density of a point process, a `Lam` object defined in `stppg.py` has to be substantiated with corresponding parameters. The most important parameters of a conditional intensity `Lam` is defined in its kernel function. See the example below.
- Regard the space of the point process, time space is specified by 1D two-elements list `T`, and location & mark space is jointly specified by 2D list `S`, where first two sub-lists indicate the location X and Y, and the following sub-lists indicate the mark space.  

### Examples

A simple example for simulating a spatio-temporal hawkes point process equipped with a standard diffusion kernel by using `stppg`.
```python
from stppg import DiffusionKernel, HawkesLam, MarkedSpatialTemporalPointProcess
from utils import plot_spatio_temporal_points, plot_spatial_intensity

np.random.seed(0)
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

# parameters initialization
mu     = .1
kernel = DiffusionKernel(C=1., beta=1., sigma_x=.1, sigma_y=.1)
lam    = HawkesLam(mu, kernel, maximum=1e+3)
pp     = SpatialTemporalPointProcess(lam)

# generate points
points, sizes = pp.generate(
    T=[0., 10.], S=[[-1., 1.], [-1., 1.]], 
    batch_size=500, verbose=True)

# plot intensity of the process over the time
plot_spatial_intensity(lam, points[0], S=[[0., 10.], [-1., 1.], [-1., 1.]],
    t_slots=1000, grid_size=50, interval=50)
```

And see the console output below.

Below are animations showing that how the spatial intensities have been evolving as the time goes by, equipped with different kinds of kernel functions, including standard diffusion kernel and ***free diffusion kernel***.

Note that the parameters of the free diffusion kernel are randomly generated by a 3-layers neural network. The spatial maps of the parameters for the Free Diffusion Kernel (3 layers neural networks) are shown below.
